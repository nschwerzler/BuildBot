## 🌟 What Makes BuildBot Special

### Not Just Cubes
Traditional Minecraft clones render everything as simple 1x1x1 cubes. BuildBot takes a different approach:

- **Trees**: Multi-voxel organic shapes with tapered trunks and natural foliage
- **Rocks**: Irregular formations with varied voxel sizes and rotations  
- **Flowers**: Detailed multi-voxel models with petals and stems
- **Grass**: Individual blades with natural variation

### Pixel Art Aesthetic
- All textures use nearest-neighbor filtering
- 16x16 or 32x32 pixel textures
- Procedurally generated textures with noise variation
- No anti-aliasing for crisp pixel-perfect rendering

## 🔧 Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Type Checking
```bash
npm run build
```

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing patterns
- Document complex algorithms
- Keep performance in mind

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Inventory system
- [ ] Crafting mechanics
- [ ] More biomes (snow, jungle, etc.)
- [ ] Day/night cycle
- [ ] Save/Load worlds
- [ ] Multiplayer support
- [ ] More block types
